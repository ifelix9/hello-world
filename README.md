I am commited to becoming a Data scientist. I'm not sure how I will do it and how long it will take me, but I believe enough
in myself to become something more than what I am today. I'm doing it not only for me but for my family. Today is July 15, 2018. The 
World Cup in Russia ended today. I vow that before the next world Cup (Qatar 2022) that I will better job as a data scientist or analyst. That I will strive to get my masters still despite financial difficulties and that me and my happier will be in a better position; happy and optimistic. I know I can do it, I have to do it now for everyone around me.  my change starts today I'm not sure how i'm going to do it but it will be done I promise myself that.  I have four years I won't lose this time too.
